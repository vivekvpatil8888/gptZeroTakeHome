const mockInputs = [`The Eiffel Tower stands as a remarkable testament to the ingenuity and innovation of late 19th-century engineering. Commissioned for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris, this iconic structure was the brainchild of Gustave Eiffel, a visionary engineer renowned for his pioneering work in metal construction.

## A Triumph of Precision Engineering

The construction of the Eiffel Tower was a marvel of precision engineering, with over 18,000 individual iron pieces meticulously designed, calculated, and assembled using more than 2 million rivets. The use of innovative techniques, such as prefabrication, allowed for the swift assembly of this towering structure, culminating in its completion in just over two years.

## Groundbreaking Design and Construction

Eiffel's design for the tower was a groundbreaking feat in itself. The curvature of the uprights was mathematically determined to offer optimal wind resistance, with the tower's distinctive arched shape resulting from Eiffel's unique construction method. This method, patented by Eiffel, allowed for the creation of a stable, self-supporting structure without the need for diagonal bracing, a revolutionary concept at the time.

The assembly process was a remarkable display of engineering prowess, with a team of skilled workers assembling the tower's components like a "gigantic erector set." The precision and efficiency of the construction process were widely acclaimed by contemporary chroniclers, solidifying the Eiffel Tower's status as an engineering marvel.

## A Lasting Legacy

Over a century later, the Eiffel Tower continues to captivate the world as a symbol of architectural splendor and engineering excellence. Its innovative design and construction techniques paved the way for future advancements in structural engineering, aerodynamics, and wind tunnel experiments. The tower's enduring legacy serves as a testament to the power of human ingenuity and the boundless potential of engineering to shape the world around us.`]
