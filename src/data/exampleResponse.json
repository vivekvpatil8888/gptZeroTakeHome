        "fulltext": "Origins and Construction of the Eiffel Tower It was for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, the date that marked the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution, that a great competition was launched in 1886. The first digging work started on the 26th January 1887. On the 31st March 1889, the Tower had been finished in record time – 2 years, 2 months and 5 days – and was established as a veritable technical feat. The Design of the Eiffel Tower The plan to build a tower 300 metres high was conceived as part of preparations for the World's Fair of 1889. Bolting the joint of two crossbowmen Bolting the joint of two crossbowmen.(c): Collection Tour Eiffel The wager was to \"study the possibility of erecting an iron tower on the Champ-de-Mars with a square base, 125 metres across and 300 metres tall\". Selected from among 107 projects, it was that of Gustave Eiffel, an entrepreneur, Maurice Koechlin and Emile Nouguier, both engineers, and Stephen Sauvestre, an architect, that was accepted. Emile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin, the two chief engineers in Eiffel's company, had the idea for a very tall tower in June 1884. It was to be designed like a large pylon with four columns of lattice work girders, separated at the base and coming together at the top, and joined to each other by more metal girders at regular intervals. The tower project was a bold extension of this principle up to a height of 300 metres - equivalent to the symbolic figure of 1000 feet. On September 18 1884 Eiffel registered a patent \"for a new configuration allowing the construction of metal supports and pylons capable of exceeding a height of 300 metres\". In order to make the project more acceptable to public opinion, Nouguier and Koechlin commissioned the architect Stephen Sauvestre to work on the project's appearance...",

        "fulltext": "Eiffel Tower It has been called a technological masterpiece in building-construction history. Built in commemoration of the French Revolution, the Eiffel Tower is one of the world's premier tourist attractions. It has been compared to the Great Pyramid of Giza and St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. Nothing remotely like it has ever been constructed. The tower is located on the Left Bank of the Seine River, at the northwestern extreme of the Parc du Champ de Mars, a park in front of the École Militaire that used to be a military parade ground. To truly appreciate this marvelous structure, let's discuss its history. The tower was built for the Paris World's Fair in 1889. When the French Government wasorganizing this event, a competition was held for designs for a suitable monument. Over 100 designs were submitted, and the World's Fair Committee selected the conception of a 984 foot (300 meter) open-lattice wrought iron tower. This design was the creation of Alexendre-Gustave Eiffel. He was a renown French civil engineer who specialized in metal construction. His previous works included an iron bridge at Bordeaux, the 540 foot (162 meter) Garabit viaduct, the moveable dome at the observatory in Nice, and the framework of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. Eiffel startled the world with the construction of the tower. In contrast to such older monuments, Eiffel's tower was completed in a matter of months with a small labor force. Eiffel made use of advanced knowledge of the behavior of metal arch and metal truss form under loading, including wind forces. His results started a revolution in civil engineering and architectural design. With the completion of the tower, Eiffel earned the nickname, \"magician of iron.\" The tower was almost torn down on several occasions and despite long and continuous protests, the tower vindicated itself aesthetically. With the advent of radio and television, the Eiffel Tower gained even greater importance as a transmission tower. For many years, it was the tallest man-made structure on earth. Eiffel Tower 2\tThis tower's dimensions are remarkable. The current height of the tower is 1069 feet (320.75 meters), which is about the equivalent of a 105-story building. It is still the tallest structure in Paris by a very wide margin. Its size is very deceiving since there are no other structures close to it. The levels accessible to the public are at heights of 189 feet (57.63 meters), or 19 stories; 380 feet (115.73 meters), or 38 stories; and 896 feet (273 meters), or 89 stories. From the summit, you can see as far away as Chartres (to the southwest) on a clear day. The base of the tower covers a square area of 328 feet (100 meters) on a side. You can stand in the center of the area at the base and look directly up at the floor of the second level, 38 stories above. The tower is built of puddled iron (very pure structural iron), and weights 7300 metric tons. It is extremely light. The tower actually weighs less than the air that surrounds it! If a scale model of the tower one foot (30 cm) high were constructed, it would weigh only as much as a nickel (seven grams)! The four pillars supporting the tower are aligned to the points of the compass. You can use the tower as a reference to find you way in Paris. Another unique feature is the tower's base. The four semi-circular arches required elevators to ascend on a curve. The glass-cage machines were designed by the Otis Elevator Company of the United States. These elevators provide visitors a fantastic view as they ride to the top of the tower. This tower moves in the wind. On days with high, gusting winds, the wind can reach speeds in excess of 100 mph (160 kph) at the summit of the tower. Visitors can feel the tower swaying gently at the summit. Under such wind conditions, the tower is usually closed to the public, although there is always an engineer present at the summit to monitor telecommunications equipment. The magnitude of the sway in the tower, under worst-case conditions, is about six inches (15 cm). There is no danger of the tower being damaged by wind-induced movement since it is designed to withstand movements easily five times beyond those produced by the highest winds ever recorded. Today, the movements are monitored by a laser alignment system. The tower also leans very slightly in bright sunlight, as one side is heated by the sun and expands slightly...",

Science Quotes by Gustave Eiffel (11 quotes) [It has been ascertained by statistical observation that in engineering enterprises one man is killed for every million francs that is spent on the works.] Supposing you have to build a bridge at an expense of one hundred million francs, you must be prepared for the death of one hundred men. In building the Eiffel Tower, which was a construction costing six million and a half, we only lost four men, thus remaining below the average. In the construction of the Forth Bridge, 55 men were lost in over 45,000,000 francs' worth of work. That would appear to be a large number according to the general rule, but when the special risks are remembered, this number shows as a very small one. ᅳ Gustave Eiffel As quoted in 'M. Eiffel and the Forth Bridge', The Tablet (15 Mar 1890), 75, 400. Similarly quoted in Robert Harborough Sherard, Twenty Years in Paris: Being Some Recollections of a Literary Life (1905), 169, which adds to the end “, and reflects very great credit on the engineers for the precautions which they took on behalf of their men.” Sherard gave the context that Eiffel was at the inauguration [4 Mar 1890] of the Forth Bridge, and gave this compliment when conversing there with the Prince of Wales. Being the most striking manifestation of the art of metal structures by which our engineers have shown in Europe, it [the Eiffel Tower] is one of the most striking of our modern national genius. ᅳ Gustave Eiffel...",
