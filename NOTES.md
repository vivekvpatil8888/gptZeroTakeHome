# Improvements

- I think the UI for the textarea can be improved by removing the scroll bar and making the remaining two corners rounded.

- I have not tested well with the API, I would do that.

- Go button can be spammed, I would try to rate limit or throttle it.

- I would add an animated loading state while waiting for the API to return the data.

- Client side caching can be done.

- The challenge description was difficult to understand.
